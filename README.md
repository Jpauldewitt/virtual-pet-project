# Virtual Pet
This is my version of a Tamagotchi or DigiPet. I based my virutal pet on my own dog Argo.

The user is given 3 lives, and the object of the game is to keep Argo's stats, that are randomly generated between 20 and 70, below 100.

The stats are increased every turn by a tick method representing the passage of time, and the stats are also updated based on the users selection of what they want to do each turn.

If a stat reaches 100, the user loses a life. When the user no longer has any remaining lives, and a stat reaches 100, the user has offically lost the game.
